        In the fall of 1991, the Parent Committees of Sir Winston Churchill High School and St. Laurent High School were presented with proposals from the school board for the future secondary education in St. Laurent. The plan drawing the most support was one calling for the closure of both schools and the creation of a new entity, a school combining the strengths of Sir Winston Churchill and St. Laurent while offering the best opportunities for all students in the community.

        A committee made up of administrators, teachers, students and parents was created. Every aspect of the new school was discussed and after lengthy discussion, an agreement was finally reached.

        Gail Ewing, a staff member, created the name for the new school by combining the "Lauren" from St. Laurent and the "Hill" from Winston Churchill. LaurenHill was born, becoming in the fall of 1992 the center of English high school education in St.Laurent.
